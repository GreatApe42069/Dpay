To handle intermittent connection issues effectively, including errors like `[WinError 10053] An established connection was aborted by the software in your host machine`, you can introduce a robust retry mechanism in your script. This mechanism will attempt to reconnect to the RPC server periodically and resume the minting process only when the connection is successfully re-established.

Here's an enhanced version of your script with a safeguard that continuously checks for the restoration of the RPC connection and the general availability of the host machine:

```python
import subprocess
import time
import json
import re
import os
from bitcoinrpc.authproxy import AuthServiceProxy, JSONRPCException, JSONRPCConnectionError

# Setup environment variables and RPC connection
rpc_user = os.getenv('RPC_USER', '<username>')
rpc_password = os.getenv('RPC_PASSWORD', '<password>')
rpc_host = os.getenv('RPC_HOST', 'localhost')
rpc_port = os.getenv('RPC_PORT', '22555')

def get_rpc_connection():
    """Attempt to establish an RPC connection."""
    try:
        return AuthServiceProxy(f"http://{rpc_user}:{rpc_password}@{rpc_host}:{rpc_port}/")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Failed to connect to RPC: {e}")
        return None

def check_connection(rpc_connection):
    """Check if the RPC connection is alive by pinging the server."""
    try:
        if rpc_connection is not None:
            rpc_connection.getblockchaininfo()  # Sample method to check connection
            return True
    except (JSONRPCConnectionError, Exception) as e:
        print(f"Connection check failed: {e}")
    return False

def ensure_connection():
    """Ensure the RPC connection is available, with retries if necessary."""
    rpc_connection = get_rpc_connection()
    while not check_connection(rpc_connection):
        print("Waiting for connection to be restored...")
        time.sleep(30)  # Wait for 30 seconds before retrying
        rpc_connection = get_rpc_connection()
    return rpc_connection

# Now incorporating connection checks in the minting process
def continuous_minting_process(directory, file_prefix, file_extension):
    rpc_connection = ensure_connection()
    airDropList_path = os.path.join(directory, 'AirDropList.json')
    last_txid = read_last_output('AirDropOutput.json', rpc_connection)
    details_list = extract_details(airDropList_path, rpc_connection)
    start_index = next((i for i, detail in enumerate(details_list) if detail.get('txid') == last_txid), 0)
    print(f"Resuming minting from index {start_index}.")
    process_mint_batch(start_index, details_list, directory, file_prefix, file_extension, rpc_connection)

# Including connection restoration in other required functions
def read_last_output(json_file_name, rpc_connection):
    rpc_connection = ensure_connection()  # Check and restore connection if needed
    try:
        if os.path.exists(json_file_name):
            with open(json_file_name, 'r') as file:
                data = json.load(file)
                last_entry = max(data.values(), key=lambda x: x['txid']) if data else None
                return last_entry['txid'] if last_entry else None
    except json.JSONDecodeError as e:
        print(f"JSON decode error in {json_file_name}: {e}")
    except KeyError as e:
        print(f"Missing expected key in JSON data: {e}")
    return None

def process_mint_batch(start_index, details_list, directory, file_prefix, file_extension, rpc_connection):
    for detail in details_list[start_index:]:
        rpc_connection = ensure_connection()  # Ensure connection is alive before processing
        file_number = str(detail['index']).zfill(5)
        image_path = os.path.join(directory, f"{file_prefix}{file_number}.{file_extension}")
        if not os.path.exists(image_path):
            print(f"File not found: {image_path}")
            continue
        mint_command = f"node . mint {detail['dogecoin_address']} {image_path}"
        print(f"Executing command: {mint_command}")
        result_mint = http://subprocess.run(mint_command, shell=True, capture_output=True, text=True)
        print("Output from mint command:", result_mint.stdout)
        if result_mint.stderr:
            print("Error in mint command:", result_mint.stderr)
        txid_search = http://re.search("inscription txid: (\\w+)", result_mint.stdout)
        if txid_search:
            last_txid = txid_search.group(1) + "i0"
            print(f"Successful mint, TXID: {last_txid}")

# Initialize main variables and start the process
directory = r'E:\newminternode\dogecoin-ordinals-drc-20-inscription\DogPartyHTMLS'
file_prefix = 'dogparty'
file_extension = 'html'

continuous_minting_process(directory, file_prefix, file_extension)

```

### Key Enhancements:
1. **`get_rpc_connection` Function**: This function tries to establish an RPC connection and handles failures gracefully.
2. **`check_connection` Function**: It checks if the RPC connection is still alive by making a blockchain-related query.
3. **`ensure_connection` Function**: It ensures that the connection is active before proceeding, and retries every 30 seconds if the connection is down.
4. **Connection Check in Strategic Places**: Connection checks are integrated before significant actions, such as before reading from the JSON file and before processing each batch, to ensure that operations are paused when there is a connection issue, and resumed once the connection is restored.

This robust mechanism will help mitigate disruptions caused by RPC or host connection issues, allowing your minting operations to proceed smoothly once the connection is re-established.
